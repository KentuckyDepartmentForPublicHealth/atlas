pediatric brain tumor
gene expression atlas; only 1 available in the world
incentive
brain tumor diversity

70 diff kinds of brain tumors
no other organ can produce this many;
other organs, can produce tops 5
panoram; pediatric mortality
worldwide: TARGET; cancer genome atlas, int. cancer genome consortium (have left out kids)
tumor transcriptomic atlas; (brain tumor samples from world);
gene probe -> gene expression; rna data
expanded atlas to include adults (compare/contrast children vs. kids)
ignore R code;
gene expression data (first column lines up with below)
atlas_data.csv (has all metadata) for gene expression data
Q. Do i have to link?

TSNE plot (non linear); 20,000 x 7,000 samples (150M data data points)
TSA linear
PCA linear; non linear (reduction) to make it 2 dimensions
tsne1 vs tsne2 roughly equiv to x, y

glioVis explore

gliovis.bioinfo.cnio.es (doesnt allow comparison between studies and between cancers)
"here is data for x"
study A vs study C; didnt do batch comparisons
only 2 kinds of cancers


data and metadata in background
brain tumor atlas

selectInput (rawnames, col names) "only look at metablastomas"

Gene:
compare gene across all cancers -> plot / data
compare survival...
correlations..
clunky, not synthesized.. elaborate
'be prepared for massive traffic'

data
gene -> rds
atlas data csv

compare all tumors at once; scientists cannot compare data from 2 studies
which cancer types do you want? instead of picking the study? 52 cancer types.

BACKGROUND: SEND ME

"Brain Tumor Atlas"
Transcriptomic [Atlas of Nervous System Tumors]
Gene Expression Atlas for Nervous System Tumors

INPUTS:
diagnosis (one or multiple) (cols in CSV..
optional (filter: age? cut into groups)
provide numeric age if left blank

CLINICAL DATA: variables ("useless")
!!! IMPORT !!! TUMOR DATA & PATIENT DATA


return -> original histoloy; final diagnsosis (pick one or the other, orign hist or final diagnosis)

further select on: compartment, location, grade, user select one or more genes.. (user provided list?; have to match what is available in the list)

OUTPUTS:

PLOT; BOXPLOT

X axis: selected cancers.. Y axis: mRNA (value in atlas data frame)

SURVIVAL:
kaplan meier hazard ratio optimal cutoff
takes available survival data
binary based on median, high or low
tells which value influences -> optimal cutoff

survival tab replicated for every gene they have

(perhaps limit 5 genes.. for survival.. so plot doesn't blow up)

mainly scientific community

THEMING COLORS: DARK MODE/LIGHT MODE..

make language lay,

panaram.. dark mode..

"i want hue" "colorblind friendly" medialab.github.io

'modifiable over time.. working on a second atlas.."

interactivity: TSNE plot. plotly.. select points -> show raw data
