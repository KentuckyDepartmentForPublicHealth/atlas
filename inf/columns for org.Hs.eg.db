"ENSEMBLTRANS": Ensembl transcript ID
"ENTREZID": Entrez Gene ID (used as keytype in your example)
"ENZYME": Enzyme Commission (EC) number
"EVIDENCE": Evidence for the annotation
"EVIDENCEALL": All evidence for the annotation
"GENENAME": Gene name (used in your example)
"GENETYPE": Type of gene
"GO": Gene Ontology (GO) terms
