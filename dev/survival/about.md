## Survival Analysis Explorer

This app allows you to analyze survival data using Kaplan-Meier curves.

### Key Features:
- Stratify survival by different grouping variables
- View risk tables and survival statistics
- Perform pairwise comparisons between groups
- Visualize confidence intervals

### Interpreting the Plot:
- **Solid lines**: Survival probability curves for each group
- **Vertical tick marks**: Censored observations
- **Dashed vertical lines**: Median survival times
- **Risk table**: Number of patients at risk at each time point

### Notes:
- Groups with very few observations may produce unreliable estimates
- The log-rank test evaluates whether there is a difference in survival between groups
- Pairwise comparisons may not be valid with many small groups
